## The Question I Can't Stop Asking

Most people ask *"how do I build AI that succeeds?"*

I asked something different: **what happens when you build AI that has nothing to succeed at?**

No fitness function. No reward signal. No goal. Just raw evolutionary pressure — and time.

`58.3% sustained activity` across `10,000 generations`.

That's not random noise. That's emergence. And it came out of a system designed to go nowhere.

> **That's the Genesis Engine.** And it's going to GECCO 2026.

## What I Build

I'm not a "passionate learner" or "aspiring developer."  
I'm someone who runs experiments at 2am and checks the terminal output before checking my phone.

```python
# My research question, distilled
def genesis_engine(population, generations=10_000):
    # No goal. No reward. Just selection pressure.
    # Watch what survives.
    for gen in range(generations):
        population = evolve(population, fitness=None)  # <-- this is the point
    return what_remained(population)

# Result: 58.3% activity. Sustained. Unexplained. Fascinating.
```

### 🧬 Genesis Engine
**Constraint-Driven Evolutionary AI**

Built a system where agents evolve under environmental constraints — zero explicit objective. The question was whether meaningful structure would emerge anyway.

It did.

- 📈 `58.3%` sustained behavioral activity
- 🔬 Accepted to **GECCO 2026**
- 🧠 Novel framework for goalless AI systems
- 🛠️ Python · DEAP · NumPy · Matplotlib

### 👁️ VisionIRL
**Computer Vision Meets the Real World**

Because the gap between "works on benchmark datasets" and "works on your phone camera" is embarrassingly wide. This closes it.

- ⚡ Real-time inference pipeline
- 📱 Edge-device optimized
- 🎯 Designed for deployment, not demos
- 🛠️ Python · OpenCV · TensorFlow Lite

### 🏆 Google Hackathon Project
**Built Under Pressure. Shipped Anyway.**

Some projects you plan for months.  
Some you build in 24 hours with 3 other humans on caffeine.  
This was the second kind. It worked.

### 🔭 What's Next
**Currently in the lab:**

- Extending Genesis Engine post-GECCO
- Exploring how constraint shapes intelligence (not just behavior)
- Asking questions that don't have papers yet

*The best projects start with "I wonder if..."*

## Let's Think Together

I'm most interested in people who ask strange questions and follow them seriously.

If you're working on **evolutionary computation, emergent AI behavior, or systems that surprise their creators** — let's talk.
